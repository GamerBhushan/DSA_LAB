Assignment Title: "Write a program to implement a word suggestion system for crossword puzzles using a Trie data structure. The program should allow the user to input the word length, number of known characters, and a partially completed word (with placeholders for unknown letters). The system should then provide a list of possible word matches from a predefined dictionary, utilizing a Trie data structure for efficient matching."

Problem Statement: This assignment involves using the Trie data structure, commonly used in various real-world applications like autocomplete systems, search engines, and word games. The task is to implement a word suggestion system for crossword puzzles, allowing the user to input partial words with missing letters (represented as '?') and receive possible word suggestions based on the given pattern. The system could also leverage DFS to efficiently explore potential word matches in a predefined dictionary.

Description
User Input:
Word length: Specifies the length of the target word.
Number of known letters: Indicates how many letters in the word are known.
Pattern: Partially completed word with ? as a placeholder for unknown letters (e.g., f??st).
Processing:
The program uses a Trie to store and search for words from a dictionary.
Suggests words that match the given pattern and satisfy the number of known letters.
Output:
A list of matching words from the dictionary.
Example: Input f??st with word length 5 and 3 known letters might output:
['frost', 'foist', 'first', 'feast', 'feist', 'faust'].
This assignment aims to introduces concepts like pattern matching and dictionary lookup. It enhances logical thinking by implementing string search and manipulation.
This type of problem closely mirrors real-world scenarios, such as:
Autocomplete systems: Common in search engines, text editors, and mobile applications.
Spell checkers and word games: Used in applications such as crossword puzzles, Scrabble, and word search games.
Recommendation engines: Similar logic is applied when suggesting words based on partial inputs, leveraging data structures like Trie and search algorithms.
